Potential Classes and their uses
1. HWTimers
    a. .Setup
        i. This will set up the hardware timer on the arduino
        ii. Inputs are prescalar, etc.

2. BeerTimer
    a. .Set
        i. Set a timer to go off after a certain amount of time has elapsed

        i. Setup one or several thermometers
        ii. Inputs will be number of thermometers and respective pins
    b. .Temp
        i. This will print the temperature of a thermometer
        ii. Input is the thermometer number you want the temperature of

4. BeerButtons
